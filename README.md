 <u><b>Methodology-</b></u>
 
A number of various maps are used  for this study to assist the stakeholders in order to inform them about the most correct or the suitable place where they can start their venture comparing it with other neighbourhood places and its information related to population, size of the market and income of the people

 <u><b>Results-</b></u>
 
Looking at the maps and comparing it, this can be stated that most of the stores are near the main street which is in the south of the city and also the population with having a good income can be found on the north side of the city. 

<u><b>Discussion-</b></u>

In this study I was not able to find the places where other food shops are available as that can help more in selecting a right place for the food point. Although, the places where people with good income are can be seen on the maps and that can be a good place of choice for opening a food shop. 

<u><b>Conclusion-</b></u>

the study done will help the stakeholders to select a place where they can open their food venture comparing with the neighbourhood and with respect to the population in the area specially with good income. The drawback is this study does not have all the aspects covered hence, while taking a decision other decision-making tools and further analysis should be carried out.
